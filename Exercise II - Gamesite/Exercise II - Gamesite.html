            UPDATING YOUR GAME:<br>
            When updating your game, you can simply replace the old files in the game directory folder with the new files from the zip. Your save will still work as is, so you don't need to 
            do anything about that. Your save file is located in a different location on your computer, so replacing your files in the game directory will not affect your save.

            TROUBLESHOOTING<br>
            If you have a problem with your save file or settings, you can navigate to:<br>
            Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\HoloCure<br>
            and delete "save_n.dat" or "settings.json" to reset your game.<br>
            NOTE:  If you delete "save_n.dat", you will lose ALL progress in your game and start as a fresh new game.<br>
            Deleting "settings.json" will only reset your game settings, and you will not lose any progress.<br>
            This game is currently for Windows PC only. Our small team wants to focus on new content and bugfixing first and foremost at this time.<br>
            There are still no plans for a mobile version. (November 15, 2024)<br>
